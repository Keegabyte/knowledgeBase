# MLE Knowledge Base

A collection of notes, guides, and descriptions of the computer and software systems that comprise MLE's operations.

This site is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. The content is written in simple Markdown files, which are automatically converted into a static website.

## How to Contribute

Contributing is the best way to help us keep this knowledge base up-to-date. All you need is a GitHub account. The following steps will guide you through editing a file, which includes creating your own personal copy (a "fork") of the repository and submitting your changes for review (a "pull request").

### Editing an Existing Page (The Easiest Way)

1.  **Find the file on GitHub:** In the main repository, navigate to the `docs/` directory and find the file for the page you want to edit.
2.  **Click the Edit icon:** In the top-right corner of the file view, click the pencil icon ("Edit this file").
3.  **GitHub Creates Your Fork:** If you don't have direct edit access, GitHub will automatically create a personal copy (a "fork") of this repository for you. You'll see a notice at the top of the page explaining this. This is your personal workspace where you can make changes safely.
4.  **Make Your Changes:** Use the web editor to make your desired changes to the content.
5.  **Describe Your Change:** Scroll to the bottom. In the first text box, write a short, clear summary of your changes (e.g., "Updated contact info for the Marketing department").
6.  **Propose the Change:** Click the green "Propose changes" button. This saves the changes to a new branch in your personal fork.
7.  **Create the Pull Request:** You'll be taken to a new page to open a "pull request." This is how you ask the project maintainers to review your changes and add them to the main knowledge base. Simply click the green "Create pull request" button.

That's it! Your proposed change will be sent for review.

### Adding a New Page

This process is slightly more manual.

1.  **Fork the Repository First:** Go to the main page of the [knowledgeBase repository](https://github.com/minor-league-esports/knowledgeBase) and click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner. This creates your own copy.
2.  **Navigate to the `docs/` Directory in Your Fork:** Make sure you are in your forked repository (the URL will be `github.com/YourUsername/knowledgeBase`). Go to the `docs/` directory (or a subdirectory) where you want to add the page.
3.  **Create the File:** In the top-right corner, click **Add file** > **Create new file**.
4.  **Name Your File:** Give your file a descriptive name that ends with `.md` (e.g., `new-style-guide.md`).
5.  **Add Your Content:** Write your content using Markdown.
6.  **Commit the New File:** At the bottom, provide a short description and click "Commit new file." This saves the file to your fork.
7.  **Open a Pull Request:** Navigate to the "Pull requests" tab in your forked repository and click the "New pull request" button. Follow the prompts to create a pull request, which sends your new page to the main repository for review.
