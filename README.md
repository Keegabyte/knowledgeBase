# MLE Knowledge Base

A collection of notes, guides, and descriptions of the computer and software systems that comprise MLE's operations.

This site is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. The content is written in simple Markdown files, which are automatically converted into a static website.

## How to Contribute

Contributing to the knowledge base is easy. You only need a GitHub account and a web browser.

### Adding a New Page

1.  Navigate to the `docs/` directory in this repository.
2.  Click the **Add file** > **Create new file** button.
3.  Name your file something descriptive, ending with `.md`. For example, `my-new-guide.md`.
4.  Add your content in Markdown format.
5.  Commit the file directly to the `main` branch.

That's it! The new page will be automatically added to the site's navigation and deployed.

### Editing an Existing Page

1.  Find the page you want to edit on the live website.
2.  Click the "Edit this page" icon (a pencil) in the top right corner.
3.  This will take you directly to the corresponding Markdown file on GitHub.

The changes will be reflected on the live site within a few minutes.
