# Welcome to the MLE Knowledge Base!

Hello and welcome, MLE staff!

We're excited to launch this new, centralized knowledge base. Our goal is to create a single source of truth where every department can share their processes, guides, and important information with the rest of the organization. By documenting our collective knowledge, we can improve collaboration, streamline onboarding, and make it easier for everyone to find the information they need to excel.

## Important: This Site is Public

Please be aware that this website is publicly accessible on the internet. Do not add any sensitive or private information to these pages. Any information that requires access control (like personal data, financial details, or private credentials) should remain in its current, secure location, such as our shared Google Drive folders.

## How You Can Contribute

This knowledge base is for everyone, and we need your help to make it truly useful! If you have information to share, you can easily add or edit pages.

1.  Find the page you want to edit on the live website.
2.  Click the "Edit this page" icon (a pencil) in the top right corner.
3.  This will take you directly to the corresponding Markdown file on GitHub.
4.  Make your changes in the web editor and commit them to the `main` branch.

To add a new page, you can navigate to the `docs/` directory in the repository and create a new `.md` file.

## Let's Build This Together!

A knowledge base is only as good as the information within it. We encourage every member of the MLE staff to take an active role in populating this site. If you see something missing, add it! If a process is unclear, clarify it! Your contributions are essential to making this a powerful resource for all of us.
