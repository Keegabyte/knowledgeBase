## FAQ

### How do I use this?
You can see a list of commands for this bot [here](https://github.com/Minor-League-Esports/modmail/blob/main/docs/commands.md).

### This is brand new but looks a lot like the old one, are the logs and snippets saved?
No, unfortunately. Due to the nature of how the old bot was hosted, we were unable to save the old logs and message snippets. You will have to make new snippets.
