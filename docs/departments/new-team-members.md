# New Team Members - Start Here

## Welcome to the team!
Welcome to the MLE Development team. We understand it can be overwhelming getting used to a new development environment, ESPECIALLY in this case. No matter how much experience you have, you can help here. Below you'll see what skills we mostly use and where they are used. This way, 
you can either get to work right away OR see what you need to learn to be of assistance.

## Getting Started
- **DM Keegabyte for Click Up access:** We use Click Up for our project management and a lot of information sharing. DM Keegabyte for access to the clickup workspace. He will need an email that you would be willing to make a Click Up account under.
- **Introduce yourself:** Introduce yourself to the team. I promise, we're friendly.
- **Consult the [Systems Overview](systems-overview.md):** Here you can see what systems we manage and who to contact about getting involved in those systems.

## General Skills
These are some skills that are used practically everywhere.

## In-Demand Skills
These are our current needs...

- **Database Design:** Several projects are in need of database designers. SQL, Sheets, and data analysis skills will be required.

- **Web development:** Many of our current and future applications rely on web interfaces. Javascript, HTML, and CSS are required.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Our Evidence, Sprocket, and user management products each heavily use data analysis. Python and Google Sheets will be required.
